Welcome to our collaborative bioinformatics machine learning project! The structure of this project is a work-in-progress, so please reach out to us if you think we should be doing something differently.

### Getting Started

We will be storing our code in this GitHub repository as it gives us a nice tool to:
  - Organize and keep track of code for each project we're working on through GitHub's 'Issues' and 'Projects'
  - Formally review eachother's code through 'Pull Requests'
  - Easily access eachother's code for referencing, testing and debugging
  
As a plus, having a basic understanding of Git & source control goes a long way in a professional development job!

To install git, there's a few options depending on your system.

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

https://git-scm.com/downloads

If you installed it successfully, you should be able to run the following command error-free in your terminal:

`git --version`

Next, clone this repository. To do so, navigate to your desired folder on your machine, then run: 

`git clone https://github.com/DeadlineWasYesterday/ML`

You may need to enter your GitHub credentials.

Next, change into the repository directory:

`cd ML`

and make your own branch. Try to give it a descriptive name if you can, starting with your name or username:

`git checkout -b myname/my-machine-learning-project` (e.g. `evan/simple-regression-project`)

Now you're on your own branch, start coding! We'll have a more formal folder structure when we get started.

Here's a fun interactive way to learn basic Git commands:
